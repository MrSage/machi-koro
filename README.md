# Introduction

Machi Koro is a fun board game, go check it out:
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143884/machi-koro

This is an implementation of the board game.

# Help-needed

## Translation

I would love to hear from you if you're interested in helping out.
Most important: I only have a Dutch edition of the game, so the implemention uses dutch text for the cards.
If you own the English you can help me out by translating the cards.js file. Open an issue to get in touch.
Once I have the English texts I will introduce the option to switch between languages.

## Expansions

I don't own any expansions. If you do, I would love to hear from you.

# Development

To get started, run `npm run dev`. After a few seconds the game should open in your browser.
